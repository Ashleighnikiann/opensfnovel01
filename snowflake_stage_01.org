* Snowflake Stage 01 -- Story Lines
This is the file where we'll pick our storylines for the very first
part of the snowflake.

Ideally, I'd like to see 10 or 20 story lines before we get into
voting. And only contributors with accepted pull requests get to vote
come the voting stage.

** Examples

1. A group of writers come together to create a catching story but may
   be thwarted by interest or technology. 

2. A hobbit learns that he must risk his life to destroy a priceless
   family heirloom to save the world from the Devil.
